## How to use

### Step 1

To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager. Which user script manager you can use depends on which browser you use.

It should work in all the managers listed below, but only [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) in Chrome is tested.

* Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
